# machine-learning-workbooks
 
A series of introductory workbooks I have created to teach machine learning to people who want to use it in an applied context.

Exercise solutions are available upon request. The reason is in case I want to use these as exercises for graded homework in the future (similar policy as [openintro](https://www.openintro.org/blog/article/2021-02-15-why-dont-we-release-all-exercise-solutions/)). I may aim in the future to similarly break these into even and odd questions and only restrict the odd questions...

|  09 | Neural Networks pt.1                     |
|  10 | Neural Networks pt.2                     |

__TODO__
- change the "Classical" Classification to account for an additional regression notebook
