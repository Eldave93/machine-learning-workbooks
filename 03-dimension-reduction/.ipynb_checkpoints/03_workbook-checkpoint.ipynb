    "\n",
    "In order to reduce a models complexity, run time, and potential for overfitting to the training data, dimension reduction techniques can be used. Broadly they can be grouped into methods that create a subset of the original set of features (Feature Selection) and methods that create new synthetic features through combining the original features and discarding less important ones (Feature Extraction). Essentially we want to remove \"uninformative infromation\" and retain useful bits<sup>1</sup>. If you have too many features, it may be that some of them are highly correlated and therefore redundant. Therefore we can either select just some of them, or compress them onto a lower dimensional subspace<sup>2</sup>.\n",
