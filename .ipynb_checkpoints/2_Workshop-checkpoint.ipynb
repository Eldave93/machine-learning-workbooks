    "> Welcome to Machine Learning Housing Corporation! The first task you are asked to perform is to build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts” for short.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The first question to ask your boss is what exactly is the business objective; building a model is probably not the end goal. How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model? This is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, what algorithms you will select, what performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you should spend tweaking it. Your boss answers that your model’s output (a prediction of a district’s median housing price) will be fed to another Machine Learning system (see Figure 2-2), along with many other signals.$^3$\n",
    "This downstream system will determine whether it is worth investing in a given area or not. Getting this right is critical, as it directly affects revenue.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The next question to ask is what the current solution looks like (if any). It will often give you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem. Your boss answers that the district housing prices are currently estimated manually by experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district, and when they cannot get the median housing price, they estimate it using complex rules.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; in cases where they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their estimates were off by more than 20%. This is why the company thinks that it would be useful to train a model to predict a district’s median housing price given other data about that district. The census data looks like a great dataset to exploit for this pur‐ pose, since it includes the median housing prices of thousands of districts, as well as other data.\n",

    "So this week we covered a lot of ground! We've looked at some methods for pre-processing our data, cleaning and preparing it, as well as how to engineer some features. This is by no means a complete collection of all the methods available as covering more would go beyond the scope of this course (for those interested in learning more, have a look though the references used in the lectures and this notebook). For example, we did not touch on handling text and dates/time much. These topics are quite complex and have enough materials to cover their own courses. Indeed at Edinburgh there are dedicated courses such as Text Technologies for Data Science (INFR11145) and Time Series (MATH11131). "

The ordering of the data depends on where it came from and how it was exported and it's not uncommon that real world data is sorted in some manner. Therefore if there is an order according to one of the attributes, we could have a very poor test set (e.g. if it was ordered by \"ocean_proximity\" we would never learn from observations near the ocean).\n",
