Instead we are going to split our training data again and see how different models affect a validation set.

    "__Ensures Information Bleed Prevention__\n",
    "\n",
    "If we did all our preprocessing steps before splitting the data into training and validation steps, we would bleed information from our validation set for training the models. For example, we scaled our features which requires us taking a mean and standard deviation of the data we'll train our model on. If these means and standard deviations include the data we will use for validation they may very slightly improve our result and then when we later make predictions on the test set we may find performance is slightly worse than expected as we truely did not use any information from that set! Over time these small amounts of information bleed may add up and mean our validation set is no longer as useful assessing how our model performs on other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So did this effect us because we did pre-processing steps before splitting our data? Nope because we use pipleines. When we used `.fit(X_train, y_train)` as above, this overwrites the parameters of the pre-processing steps and the model so we can be assured this only reflects information from this set. Sure you could go step by step using `.fit_transform()` on your data and passing the output to the next function, but this would not be as simple as putting them all in a `Pipeline`. Another way round would be to split your data into training and validation sets before pre-processing your data to stop you needing to re-fit your pre-processing steps later. This would work, but using a `Pipeline` works well with other validation methods too (so saves us some additional coding)...\n",

    "Heres where `Pipelines` really start to get useful (and we'll see more extensions later). So far we've used the `train_test_split` function to split the training set into a smaller training set and a validation set, which we have used to validate our models. This works well, but by partitioning the available data into three sets, we reduce the number of samples that can be used for learning the model, and the results depend on the random choice of the pair of (train, validation) sets. A great alternative is therefore to use Scikit-Learn’s _K-fold cross-validation_ feature. A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV.\n",

The difference in score for this pipeline between the training set and validation set is however still larger than the linear regression model, suggesting there is some overfitting occouring here.
