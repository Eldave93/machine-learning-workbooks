    "You will find that in a lot of cases you won't need to write much code to answer the exercises (we're just getting started after all!), but there are some \"extra\" questions that require a bit more for those who want more of a stretch. Also as a lot of stuff will be new this week, there is a lot of written text here to help guide you along!\n",

    "\n",
    "Its worth now taking a step back and examining what is meant by a \"Pipeline\". A general definition is that it is just a sequence of data preparation operations that is ensured to be reproducible. However, we may want to ensure that any functions/classes we make for our pipeline have specific attributes that work best with the tools available in our chosen machine learning library (`Scikit-learn`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "__Scikit-learn__\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and many other utilities. In Scikit-Learn a `Pipeline` is a class we can use to combine our pre-processing and modelling steps together (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html). Objects that go into a scikit-learn `Pipeline` can either be [_transformer_](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html#dataset-transformations) or [_estimator_](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#estimators) classes, or, if we use an imbalanced-learn `Pipeline` instead, also a _resampler_.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to use pipelines can be a little more tricky at first but its better practice than not using them so its worth trying! It will prevent you from making common mistakes. If you don't want to use them then thats fine, but be careful to check you are not \"bleeding\" information from your training set into your validation or test sets (more on this later). In otherwords, make sure your models cannot peak or get any idea what is in these separate datasets we use to check how they perform!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to remove duplicate _observations_ from our training data using a function that is compatible with a `Pipeline`, we are going to need to turn it into a _resampler_.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Resamplers__\n",
    "\n",
    "Resamplers are classes that follow the scikit-learn API and have a sampling functionality through the `.resample()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all other scikit-learn methods (e.g. _transformers_ and _estimators_), they have a `.fit()` method which is only applied during pipeline training, which is used to...\n",
    "- ...validate and interpret any parameters, \n",
    "- ...validate the input data, \n",
    "- ...estimate and store attributes from the parameters and provided data, \n",
    "- ...return the fitted object to facilitate method chaining in a pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with other sample properties (e.g. `sample_weight`), the `.fit()` method usually takes 2 inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The samples matrix (or design matrix) X. The size of X is typically (n_samples, n_features), which means that samples are represented as rows and features are represented as columns.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - The target values y which are real numbers for regression tasks, or integers for classification (or any other discrete set of values). For unsupervized learning tasks, y does not need to be specified. y is usually 1d array where the ith entry corresponds to the target of the i th sample (row) of X.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods available for these objects other than `.fit()` will depend on what they are, so we will look at each of these objects in turn and then combine them into a model pipeline later in this workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to create our own resampler from scratch that is compatible with scikit-learn, we have to make a class that has two methods; `.fit()` and `.fit_resample()` (see https://imbalanced-learn.org/dev/references/generated/imblearn.FunctionSampler.html). If we want to resample a dataset, we just need to use the latter method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data_resampled, targets_resampled = obj.fit_resample(data, targets)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at making custom pipeline functions in the next (optional) notebook, but for now we can just wrap our `drop_duplicated` function we just made in the handy `FunctionSampler` from `imblearn` to make the function we made before compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Notes__\n",
    "- `imblearn` needs to be installed for the following to work.\n",
    "- Typically your functions can output a `pd.DataFrame` or a `np.Array` to be put into a pipeline, however generally you should try work with numpy arrays. This is because although a pandas dataframe can be used as an input to scikit-learn objects, they will typically output NumPy arrays or SciPy sparse matrices (this is quite a sensible design choice as explained [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0238)). If you want to chain your methods together, then working with numpy arrays generally make it easier (although there are exceptions!). It is however worth noting that _\"Unlike scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn provides support for pandas in/out. Therefore providing a dataframe, will output as well a dataframe\"_<sup>1</sup>.\n",
    "- Technically a sampler is intended to be used to \"sample\" data, but it is useful in this case as samplers fundamentally are used to reduce or increase the number of samples (observations) in both our feature data (`X_train`) and our targets (`y_train`) data which we need to do in this cleaning step.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Ensures Information Bleed Prevention__\n",
    "\n",
    "If we did all our preprocessing steps before splitting the data into training and validation steps, we would bleed information from our validation set for training the models. For example, we scaled our features which requires us taking a mean and standard deviation of the data we'll train our model on. If these means and standard deviations include the data we will use for validation they may very slightly improve our result and then when we later make predictions on the test set we may find performance is slightly worse than expected as we truely did not use any information from that set! Over time these small amounts of information bleed may add up and mean our validation set is no longer as useful assessing how our model performs on other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So did this effect us because we did pre-processing steps before splitting our data? Nope because we use pipleines. When we used `.fit(X_train, y_train)` as above, this overwrites the parameters of the pre-processing steps and the model so we can be assured this only reflects information from this set. Sure you could go step by step using `.fit_transform()` on your data and passing the output to the next function, but this would not be as simple as putting them all in a `Pipeline`. Another way round would be to split your data into training and validation sets before pre-processing your data to stop you needing to re-fit your pre-processing steps later. This would work, but using a `Pipeline` works well with other validation methods too (so saves us some additional coding)...\n",
    "\n",
    "__Works well with Different Validation Methods__\n",
    "\n",
    "Heres where `Pipelines` really start to get useful (and we'll see more extensions later). So far we've used the `train_test_split` function to split the training set into a smaller training set and a validation set, which we have used to validate our models. This works well, but by partitioning the available data into three sets, we reduce the number of samples that can be used for learning the model, and the results depend on the random choice of the pair of (train, validation) sets. A great alternative is therefore to use Scikit-Learn’s _K-fold cross-validation_ feature. A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cross-validation](./Images/grid_search_cross_validation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing k-fold cross-validation, the training set is split into $k$ smaller sets and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A model is trained using $k-1$ of the folds as training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is therefore the average of the values computed in the loop. Although more computationally expensive than a single split, it does not waste too much data (particuarly useful when the number of samples is very small) and gives us more robust assessment of performance. Again, using a `Pipeline` with this method will ensure there is no information bleed between our different folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets have a look how we could evaluate our initial linear regression pipeline below with them.\n",

    "__Note__\n",
    "- You can use `cross_val_score` if you just want the validation score.\n",
    "- Note `cross_validate` calls the validation performance the `test_score`, to be clear this is the validation performance and should not be used as \"test\"! This is why I rename it in the `tidy_scores` function below."

The difference in score for this pipeline between the training set and validation set is however still larger than the linear regression model, suggesting there is some overfitting occouring here.
